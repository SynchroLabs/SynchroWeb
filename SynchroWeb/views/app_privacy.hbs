    <h2>Synchro Explorer Mobile App Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy governs your use of the mobile software application Synchro Explorer (“Application”) that was 
        created by Synchro Labs, Inc.  {{#if noNav}}{{else}}For the privacy policy related to your use of this web site, please see the
        relevant <a href="/privacy">Synchro.io Site Privacy Policy</a>.{{/if}}
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The Syncho Explorer mobile application allows you to view and interact with a Synchro application that
        is hosted on a server operated by a third party (a "Synchro Endpoint").  The third parties who provide these Synchro
        Endpoints will typically be part of your own enterprise, or other organizations with which you have a business relationship.
        But in any case, the information that you explicitly provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy,
        except where noted below.  You should only use Synchro Explorer to connect to Synchro Endpoints operated by third parties 
        that themselves have acceptable privacy policies.
    </p>
    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
    <p>
        The Application does not collect any user personal information.  It may provide access to Synchro Endpoints operated by
        third-parties, where any user personal information collected by those third parties should fall under a separate privacy policy
        offered by the third-party.
    </p>

    <h2>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>
    <p>
        The Application does not collect location data on behalf of Synchro Labs, Inc.  However, when connecting to third-party Syncho Endpoints, those
        Synchro Endpoints may request location data.  If the Synchro Exporer application has been approved to provide location data, then such data may 
        be provided to the third-party Synchro Endpoint.  You should only connect to Synchro Endpoints operated by third-parties that provide acceptable
        privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want any third-party Synchro Endpoint providers to use your location, you should turn off the location services for the mobile
        application located in your device settings.
